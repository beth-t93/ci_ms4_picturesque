### User Requirements and Expectations
#### Requirements

- The user will receive feedback from the site when adding an item to basket, updating their basket and checking out


## Scope
Based on the above information, features to be included in the design include:
- An easy to navigate homepage with an obvious path to other pages
- A profile page that is only accessbile to individual users when they log in

The site will be simple to use across all devices.

## Design Choices
The style of the site will be simple and minimal so it remains easy to navigate and allows the products to be the main selling point.

### Colours

![images](docs/images/colours.png)

I have chosen a colour scheme that is minimal, but still has a pop of colour to break up the black and white.
### Fonts/Typography
I have decided to use Mulish, taken from the Google Fonts library, with sans-serif being the fallback font should either of the selected fonts be unavailable. 

This font is clean and easy to read.

## Deployment
### Github Pages
This site is deployed using GitHub pages, this was the process:
1. Log in and selected my MS2 repository
2. Go to settings in the repository
3. Go to 'Pages" in the menu
4. Click 'source'
5. Change to dropdown menu from 'none' to 'main'
6. Click the link to the deployed site once the page has reloaded

### Forking this Repository
1. Find the repository on GitHub
2. Click the 'Fork' button on the top right of the page
3. You will now have a copy of the repository on your Github account

### Cloning this Repository
1. Find the repository on Github
2. Click on 'Code'
3. To clone using HTTPS - copy the url
4. Open Git and go to the directory you want to become the cloned directory
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' and the url
6. Press enter for the clone to be created.

### Create the Flask Application
1. Install Flask - type in terminal:

``` 
pip3 install Flask 
```

2. Now we need to create a few new files. First, our Python file that will be the foundation of our application. You can name it something else, in this case, I used app.py, so type in the terminal:

```
touch app.py
```

3. Next, we will be storing some sensitive data, and we need to hide them using environment variables. You can use the terminal or just create a new file. I used the terminal, so type in the terminal:

```
touch .env
```

4. That file should never be pushed to GitHub, so we need to be able to ignore it somehow, so type in the terminal:

```
touch .gitignore
```

5. Double check in the gitignore file that you see ".env" and "pycache/"
6. Go to the env.py file and add the following:

```
import os
os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME"
```

7. Go to app.py file and import the following:

```
import os
from flask import (Flask, render_template, redirect, request,
url_for, session, flash)
from flask_pymongo import PyMongo
from bson.objectid import ObjectId
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from os import environ, path
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path
```

8. Create an instance of Flask

```
app = Flask(__name__)
```

9. To test your application, tell your app how and where to run your application. Set your IP and PORT environment variables in the hidden .env file. Make sure to update this to debug=False before the actual deployment of your project.

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(host=os.environ.get("IP"),
port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
debug=True)
```

10. You can now run your application, type in the terminal:

```
python3 app.py
```

### Deploying to Heroku
1. In the workspace terminal, run pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt to collect any dependencies.
2. Run python app.py > Procfile to create a Procfile required for Heroku deployment.
3. Go to the Heroku website. Register for an account and click on "Create a new app".
4. Setup a Heroku app within the Heroku dashboard - Type in the app name and select region the click on create app.
5. In Heroku, in your app, click on "GitHub" to connect to your repository. Type in the repository name as on GitHub. Click on "Connect".
6. Search for your repo (or sign in and connect GitHub account) and select this.
7. In the 'settings tab, click 'Reveal Config Vars' and input your environment variable from your local build in the key/value inputs.
8. Then click "Hide Config Vars" in Heroku.
9. In Heroku, select 'Automatic Deploys' to automatically rebuild the app when a new Git commit is pushed.
10. Once the initial build is complete, click 'Open App' in the top right of the screen to view the application.
